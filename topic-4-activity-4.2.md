# Topic 4 - Activity 4.2

1. **Research and discuss how usability and user experience differ from one another.**

**Usability** is about how functional a system is, e.g does it work well

A console windows that get an input number and outputs the square root of that number is very usable but has a bad user experience because most customers aren't going to be comfortable with a console.

**User Experience** is about how a user feels after they use the system

A multi-colored program that when you type a number into and the program and press enter, it throws animated confetti at you and make trumpet sounds has terrible usability but a great user experience because it dosnt really do anything but leaves the customer feeling great about pressing the enter button.

**2. Decide on the things to be considered when assessing the usability of a system?**

1. Does the program achieve its goal?
2. Is the goal achieved in the minimal amount of steps?
3. Is the program as simplified as it can be without impacting prior steps?

**3.** **Find at least one example of a system \(e.g. website, mobile app, etc.\) that demonstrates good usability and one with poor usability. Take screenshots to aid in explaining your reasoning for coming to these conclusions.**

Good usability:

The PBTech website has excellent usability, all anouncements and special offers are clearly displayed front and center on the landing page, if a customer wants to shop by brand, product type or usecase it is all dispayed on one of the navbars to the left of at the top.

Poor usability:

The COMS502 webpage has very poor usability. This is because although these assessments are laid out on the assessments page in a numbered order they are not completed in that order and the dates they need to be completed are different depending on what tab you are currently on. 

Furthermore, most of the assessments are multipart, Assessment 2 clearly states this on the assessment page and so you would think that any other multipart assessment would also state this on the assessments page and also provide the tasks and criteria for each part of that assessment. 

**This is not the case,** Assessment 4 is a multi-part assessment and to find the tasks and criteria for each part you need to navigate to one of the other tabs and search through sub-tabs until you find what you are looking for. To find out what assessments are due, which part, and in which order, you need to use the upcoming events tab and the course content &gt; index tab to find out. 

These two tabs are often different from what the assessment task says and the assessment criteria so consulting the teacher or classmate is often needed to confirm which date is the correct one. 

This turns a simple 1-5 minute job of looking to see what assessments you should be doing when they are due, and what needs to be done to complete them. Into a 15-30min confusing nightmare where all your classmates say "I have no clue" and the teacher says something completely different from any of the moodle pages. The only conclusion is that everyone's deeply confused and you just gotta guess the due date and task and wing it.
