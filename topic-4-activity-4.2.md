# Topic 4 - Activity 4.2

1. **Research and discuss how usability and user experience differ from one another.**

**Usability** is about how functional a system is, e.g does it work well

A console windows that get an input number and outputs the square root of that number is very usable but has a bad user experience because most customers aren't going to be comfortable with a console.

**User Experience** is about how a user feels after they use the system

A multi-colored program that when you type a number into and the program and press enter, it throws animated confetti at you and make trumpet sounds has terrible usability but a great user experience because it dosnt really do anything but leaves the customer feeling great about pressing the enter button.

**2. Decide on the things to be considered when assessing the usability of a system?**
