This job dosnt have a lot of information about exactly what it is but it deals with networks and cloud severs.  
  
In conclusion, I really like server tech and networking is very appealing to me as i find properly connecting different systems and getting them to seamlessly talk to each other very satisfying. I also a bit of a data horder so I the idea of large data networks and finding a use for that data very interesting.
