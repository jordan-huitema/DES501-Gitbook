**There are many aspects to learning how to write effectively for the web, so much so that it could easily form an entire course in it's own right. As an introduction, however, carry out your own research on each of the below and place your findings into the Forum. Check out what other students have discovered**

**The importance of:**

**1.knowing your audience**

If you don't know your audience you cant know what they will want or what will be appropriate for them, for example if your audience is elderly then making a complex yet powerful interface is going it make the site unusable for them.

**2 - 3.Understanding how people read on the web & Following the 'inverted pyramid' model**

I is important to ensure text has context, what i mean by this is that you need to have headings larger and bolder than paragraphs, also you may want to make tool tips or extra info grey or smaller so it does not draw the users eye immediately.

By using this technique you can avoid confusing the users with an overload of information and add more  to the page without overwhelming the user

**4.Keeping content short and simple**

By keeping content concise and simple you can translate a lot more information to the user and keep their attention longer.

**5.Chunking content**

Checking content is all about breaking content up into block or chunk so users can skim through it easier and are not confronted by a overwhelming wall of text ****and so they can more easily find the information they are looking for within the content.

**6.Using the active voice**

Using an active voice when writing web content is all about keeping the user engaged and holding their attention, active voice is when you cut out as many useless, flowery words or 'padding' in a sentence as possible so the content feels more information rich.

Active Voice: "The number increased by 1"

Passive Voice: "The number was then increased by an amount of one"

**7.Putting content into context**

This refers to the position and size of content on a page e.g. putting a video description under the video to show it is reffering to that video and not another peice of content or for example making more important content higher contrast or larger to show its significance to other content.

**8.Editing and proofreading**

This one is obvious with any content being put into the public eye, it is always important to check there are no mistakes or errors as well as check the content makes sense in the context it is being viewed.
