Aura is a security consultant company that helps businesses understand and implement effective security measures.  
Their stakeholders include:

**Investors**

People who have brought shares in the company are obviously stakeholders because the value of their shares change depending on what the company does.

**Customers**

Customers are the most effected stakeholders when it comes to security company's because they are the ones who risk their security on the word or product of the company.

**CEO/Executive's**

Executives are important stakeholders because they are incharge of the company and how it operates but are not always involved with the day to day operations or smaller decisions. This is significant because their reputaions and the company's value are often influenced by things they have control over but may be missinformed or uninformed about.
