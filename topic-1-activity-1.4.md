Ensuring a business designs its structure in a way that allows it to expand and adapt in time is crucial to avoid organizational issues in the future. A business that only has 1 HR or maintenance department is fine until you expand to multiple locations or country's and have to fly employees around to manage all your offices, wasting time and money.

An appropriate structure enables businesses to more efficiently delegate resources and logistics to the correct department/areas cutting down on costs and preventing one department hogging all the supply. Separating a company into departments allows each department to focus entirely on their specific role within the company, this allows them to be more productive and promotes innovation because they never have to many jobs on their plate.
