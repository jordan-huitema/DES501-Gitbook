#### Organization

* **Communication**: IT support can setup and implement effective solutions to workplace communication allowing managers to instantly and effectively relay information and discuss issues around the work place increasing productivity. 
* **Focus**: IT support can setup programs to help manage and keep track of jobs and tasks that need completing, this helps employ's remain focus on their next task and dont have to spend as much time juggling jobs.

#### Maintenance 

* **Updates and Security**: IT support is crucial in ensuring your systems are up to date with the latest security software and ensuring your programs and systems are compatible when they eventually become outdated and need upgrading.
* **Troubleshooting and Bug Fixing**: If your business uses computers you are eventually going to encounter a problem your employees have no knowledge of and you are going to have to find someone to fix it. This is another reason high quality and fast IT support is invaluable to a business, the less time a program, computer or employee is out of commission the better.

#### Automation and Efficiency

* **Supply Chain**: supply chains are a messy business and there are a lot of things to keep track of and subsequently a lot of things can go wrong. IT support can design and implement automated solutions to these problems greatly decreasing the amounts of work involved in running a supply chain.
* **Customer interaction**: If your a large business you probably have a lot of customers, far to many for a PR department to affordably handle on their own. This is where an automated email system or a website that answers frequently asked questions and provides info on your business can be crucial.
