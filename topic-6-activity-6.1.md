# Topic 6 - Activity 6.1

**1.Discuss what you think makes for a good web experience. Draw on your own experiences and preferences.**

Keep it simple

Use appropriate content

Dont overwhelm users with clutter

Use minimal colours, to many and you will dazzle the user

Make sure buttons stand out

**2. Consider the different opinions of group members. Does it seem that things like age, culture, previous experience makes a difference?**

In our group no, we think along the same lines but i can see how having group members of different backgrounds could effect what you think of what makes for a good web design. 

For example if a member never uses mobile sites they are not going to consider how the site may look on a phone screen, also someone who has done websites a certian way for years is unlikely to want to change they way they do their design if they like it.
