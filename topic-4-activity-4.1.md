# Topic 4 - Activity 4.1

**Challenge 1:** How effective is the design?

It if difficult to directly measure the effect of a new UX design because its it hard to tell if customers experience is being influenced by other variables.

e.g if you roll out a newer more modern looking UI and the user complaints drop, can you be sure that's not because old people are driven off by a new design and you have attracted a younger and more technologically literate audience because of the new design?

**Challenge 2:** Whats the real problem?

Customer complaints are useful but how can you be sure they are accurate? If customers complain about a new design, is it because its a worse design or are they complaining because its different from the old design and they haven't become accustomed to it.

**Challenge 3:** Bias, preference and prospective

A UX team needs to look at a design from the prospective of the user, this is difficult because developers may have different sensibility's and preferences to users.   
e.g A dev might like how their product looks with a dark theme and feel that it is a sleeker and better UX but the user might find it difficult to see menus and text under sunlight and thing a light or more vibrant theme would be a better UX.

**Challenge 4:** Prototyping

Prototyping is difficult because you need to think of everything your UI will need to accommodate a good UX, a lot of the time you can miss or not realize a crucial feature for a good UX and will need to rethink your prototype, implement it later in the development stage or put it in the next release.
