# Topic 5 - Activity 5.2

**Think of at least 4 different technologies where user interface design is an important consideration.**

**Discuss in your course One Note Class Notebook why/how the user interface approach for each of these types of devices/technologies needs to differ.**

**Media centers/ TV's**

The interface for a large screen TV needs to be easily visible from meters away and will be navigated with a number pad or arrow keys.

**Smart watches**

Smart watch interface needs to be optimized for a small display with touch functionality and potentially a dial, buttons need to be large and efficient as there is very limited screen space and processing power.

**Smartphones**

Smartphone interfaces need to be navigated by exclusively touch functionality and it is important to utilize as much screen space as possible as there is not much, menus need to be clear and always available due to a lack of potential shortcut keys.

**Ultrawide PC monitors**

with an ultrawide monitor it is important to lay information out in a landscape format or to tile the content so it can fill the screen without leaving massive ammount of white space to either side of the content wasting screenspace and making the content feel cramped.
